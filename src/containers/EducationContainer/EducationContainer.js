                <h1>Education</h1>
                <p>We believe that learning is joyful and lifelong. By creating inquiry-based experiences and tools that spark wonder; offer hands-on experiences; and encourage questions, explorations, and individual discovery, we're transforming the way people learn. Learning this way empowers people to figure things out for themselvesâ€”about science, but also about any topic, claim, or idea.</p>
                <p>If you're a teacher, parent, student, after-school educator, or professional developer, there are lots of unique resources here for you. Dive in and see what you discover.</p>
